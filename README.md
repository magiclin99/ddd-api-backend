# How to run the project

In the root directory of the project, run the following command:

```bash
make dockerRun
```

A container will be built and run automatically:

- API endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`.
- A swagger UI will be available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`. You can view and test the API endpoints
  from here.
